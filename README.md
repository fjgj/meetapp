This repository aims at showing the effectiveness of functional programming techniques 
in the development of common web-based applications, such as meetup.com.

The project includes a functional implementation of a typical microservice (actually, two implementations: one using scalaz, and the other implemented from scratch), and another one using object-oriented patterns. 

The branch [slick 3.0](https://github.com/hablapps/meetapp/tree/slick_3.0) includes a refactoring of both solutions when the database layer is migrated to slick 3.0.
